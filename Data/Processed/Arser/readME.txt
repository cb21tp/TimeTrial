The Following 2 Folders contain .CSV files for each experiment
and were generated by running The generateCSVDataFilesForEachExperiment.R script in the Scripts Folder.

This Script takes the RawData_Con.RData and RawData_Avg.RData as input from Data/Raw/ 
and outputs 300 separate experimental setups.

This is the same procedure for generating the down sampled experiments that is run for the RainAnatoolslysis.R, however The files are outputted as CSVs to be used by the other analysis (BooteJTK[Python], SW1PerS[MatLab], and ARSER[Python]) that are written in other languages, rather than being able to be processed by RAIN [R] .

CONCATENATED DATA FRAMES FOR EACH REPLICATE
ZT_times for each replicated are concatenated to the end of the data frame
ie. the columns for “8_96_NoiseLV_0.4_BioRep_3" would be

[1] “ZT_0_1"  "ZT_8_1"  "ZT_16_1" "ZT_24_1" "ZT_32_1" "ZT_40_1" "ZT_48_1" "ZT_56_1" "ZT_64_1" "ZT_72_1" "ZT_80_1"
[12] "ZT_88_1" "ZT_96_1" "ZT_0_2"  "ZT_8_2"  "ZT_16_2" "ZT_24_2" "ZT_32_2" "ZT_40_2" "ZT_48_2" "ZT_56_2" "ZT_64_2"
[23] "ZT_72_2" "ZT_80_2" "ZT_88_2" "ZT_96_2" "ZT_0_3"  "ZT_8_3"  "ZT_16_3" "ZT_24_3" "ZT_32_3" "ZT_40_3" "ZT_48_3"
[34] "ZT_56_3" "ZT_64_3" "ZT_72_3" "ZT_80_3" "ZT_88_3" "ZT_96_3"

Column Names are changed to Fit ARSER’s required input
 [1] "#" "0"   "8"   "16"  "24"  "32"  "40"  "48"  "56"  "64"  "72"  "80"  "88"  "96"  
[15] "104" "112" "120" "128" "136" "144" "152" "160" "168" "176" "184" "192" "200" "208" 
[29] "216" "224" "232" "240" "248" "256" "264" "272" "280" "288" "296" "304"


AVERAGED DATA FRAMES FOR EACH REPLICATE
ZT_times for each replicated are averaged together 
ie. the columns for "8_96_NoiseLV_0.4_BioRep_3"
 
[1] "ZT_0_1"  "ZT_8_1"  "ZT_16_1" "ZT_24_1" "ZT_32_1" "ZT_40_1" "ZT_48_1" "ZT_56_1" "ZT_64_1" "ZT_72_1" "ZT_80_1" "ZT_88_1" "ZT_96_1"
 Column Names are changed to Fit ARSER’s required input
[1] "#"  "0"  "8"  "16" "24" "32" "40" "48" "56" "64" "72" "80" "88" "96"
