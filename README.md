Welcome to TimeTrial!

TimeTrial is an interactive application for the design and optimization of omic 
time-series experiments to aid researchers in developing their experiment design. 
Consisting of two interactive applications using both synthetic and biological 
data, TimeTrial allows researchers to explore the effects of experimental design
on signal shape, examine cycling detection reproducibility across biological 
datasets, and optimize experimental design for cycle detection. 
TimeTrial is currently in beta.

Watch our [introductory video](https://vimeo.com/388290542) for TimeTrial training material.
